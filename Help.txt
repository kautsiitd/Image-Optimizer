NOTE: I know it will be very frustrating to download all these libraries in Windows from scratch and there is no surety even after that.
I have setup this software on all these platforms and It worked wonderfully, But I could not remember all steps about how I set it up in windows,
I will try to add more precise Instruction for Windows too later.
If you have set it up successfully on Windows that I will request to create a Pull Request for same stepwise.
